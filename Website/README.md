HTML

Use the html document to make changes to information about your unit that is live on your web page. Often times this is as simple as making a change to the text that is already there. Other times, adding information requires moving entire sections of code. The more changes you make, the more likely you will need help with other parts of the code to make things function properly again. Feel free to submit changes to your html to me for review before making it live.

CSS

The css document provides styling options for your Unit page.  For now you are using the default styling provided by the whole hDCG website. If you would like to use alternate styleing on your unit page, that is done through the css document.  To start, make sure all of the information about your unit is accurate and placed where you wanted on your page. Then move on the css styling if desired.

Media

Media files like logos,pictures, icons, documents, fonts, modlists, ect. all go here in the media file for reference by the html document wherever you want to show or share those items.
